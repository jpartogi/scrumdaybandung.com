<p>
<strong>Theme</strong>: Professionalism in software development <br/>
<strong>Goal</strong>: Igniting change in software ecosystem, inspiring future leaders.
</p>

                <p>
Scrum Day Bandung 2017 is an intense 1-day business agility &amp; management conference with Scrum as its framework. But we think Scrum Day Bandung is not just a conference. We think it is a community movement towards software development ecosystem that emphasizes agility and professionalism. We think software is a business needs to be competitive in 21st century. We think agility should be extended beyond IT because agility is a business needs not a methodology. The event is a perfect place to be for leaders, managers and change agents who have concerns about agility and profesionalism in software development ecosystem to meet, exchange experiences and support each other. Unlike other conferences in the region where participants only leave the event with information or knowledge, in this event participants will feel inspired and empowered to make changes in their respective companies. 
                </p>
                <p>
This event will be an exclusive event and the first business &amp; management conference with Scrum in the region. If you share our mission for an software development ecosystem that emphasizes agility and professionalism, join the movement and attend this 1-day annual event. We wish to see you at the event.
